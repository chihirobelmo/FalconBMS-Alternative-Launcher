Falcon BMS Alternative Launcher is a replacement for stock BMS launcher including key/axis
mapping feature. It can configure and save BMS SETUP per Joysticks. When you launch BMS
through this app, it auto-generates proper setup files and overwrites them for current
device order before BMS find them changed and initialize your setup. You don't have to worry
about SETUP mixing up DX order nor resets axis setups even if device sort or numbers have
been changed.

# Pay attention before use.

The app will overwrite following setup files and the Registry of Falcon BMS.
It will auto-generate backups to User/Config/Backup at its first launch.

- User/Config/axismapping.dat
- User/Config/DeviceSorting.txt
- User/Config/Falcon bms.cfg
- User/Config/joystick.cal
- User/Config/<callsign>.pop
